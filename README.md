## Project 2 by Jason Chuang


## Problem Statement

A home buyer is always concern about whether they are paying a fair value for their dream house. There could be many factors that determine the valuation of house and it will be very overwhelming for the average home buyer to understand. Besides macroeconomic factors such as interest rate for motgage, there are also demand side factors, such as taste and preference, that will affect the final price. However, It will be good if there are some key factors pertaining to the house, that home buyers can refer as a guide. 

The target audience for this analysis is potential home buyers who are looking for property in the Ames region. The objective of this analysis is to identify key factors pertaining to the house, that affect the valuation. As a result, this will be useful for them in price negotiation.


## Background

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. You are tasked with creating a regression model based on the Ames Housing Dataset. This model will predict the price of a house at sale. The Ames Housing Dataset is an exceptionally detailed and robust dataset with over 70 columns of different features relating to houses.
